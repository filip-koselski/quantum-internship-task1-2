# Task 1 - Sum of integers in the range from 1 to N
# Task 2 - Counting islands

* ```task1.py``` file contains program that calculates the sum in range 1 and N, having positive integer number N as an input. ${1 \leq N < 10^{25}}$, ${t < 0.1s}$

* ```task2.py``` file contains program that calculate the number of islands having a matrix MxN that represents a map. There are 2 possible states on the map: 1 - islands, 0 - ocean.  

* ```requirements.txt``` file contains all used libraries
